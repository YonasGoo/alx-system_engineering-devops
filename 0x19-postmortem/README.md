## Issue Summary

Outage Duration:

    Start: August 11, 2024, 05:30 AM EAT
    End: August 11, 2024, 08:15 AM EAT

Impact:
During the outage, 65% of users experienced slow loading times or were unable to access our main web application. Services affected included the main web server and the API server. Some users reported long load times, while others received a 503 Service Unavailable error.

Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a misconfigured firewall rule following a recent security update. This configuration blocked incoming HTTP and HTTPS traffic from certain IP ranges.
Timeline

    05:30 AM EAT: Monitoring alerts detected a significant drop in incoming traffic and an increase in 503 errors.
    05:35 AM EAT: On-call engineer received a notification about the issue and started an investigation.
    05:45 AM EAT: The on-call engineer checked server logs and confirmed the increase in 503 errors.
    06:00 AM EAT: Initial assumption was that the issue was due to high server load; CPU and memory usage were checked and found to be normal.
    06:15 AM EAT: The incident was escalated to the networking team after realizing that there was no issue with server load.
    06:30 AM EAT: The networking team reviewed the firewall settings but found no immediate issues.
    06:50 AM EAT: The incident was further escalated to the system architecture team.
    07:15 AM EAT: A member of the system architecture team noticed that a firewall update from the previous night might be the cause.
    07:30 AM EAT: The misconfigured firewall rule was identified as the culprit.
    07:45 AM EAT: The firewall rule was corrected to allow all necessary traffic.
    08:00 AM EAT: Monitoring systems showed a gradual recovery in traffic and reduction in errors.
    08:15 AM EAT: The incident was declared resolved as all systems were fully operational.

Root Cause and Resolution

Root Cause:
The root cause was a firewall rule that was misconfigured during a security update. This rule unintentionally blocked incoming HTTP and HTTPS requests from several IP ranges. The issue arose because of a mistake in the automated script used to apply the update, which failed to properly include all the IP ranges needed for normal operation.

Resolution:
The issue was resolved by manually correcting the firewall rule to allow incoming traffic from all necessary IP ranges. The system architecture team quickly reviewed and adjusted the firewall settings, ensuring that the updated configurations were correctly applied.
Corrective and Preventative Measures

Improvements:

    Improved Testing Procedures: Before deploying firewall updates, conduct more thorough testing, including scenarios that simulate different IP ranges and traffic types.
    Enhanced Monitoring: Implement monitoring systems that specifically alert for unusual drops in traffic and spikes in error rates.
    Change Management Process: Establish a more rigorous change management process for deploying security updates, including multiple levels of approval and automated checks.

Tasks:

    Update Firewall Scripts: Revise the automated firewall script to include comprehensive checks for all IP ranges before deployment.
    Develop Test Scenarios: Create a suite of test scenarios that cover various types of traffic to ensure firewall updates do not disrupt service.
    Implement Additional Monitoring Alerts: Add new alerts to the monitoring system to detect unusual patterns in traffic and error rates.
    Review Change Management Process: Update the change management process to include additional steps for verifying the integrity of security updates.

By taking these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to reduce the likelihood of similar outages in the future and improve our response time and effectiveness when issues do occur.
